- What are your initial impressions of Java? 
    Java requires intricate thinking and planning in order to execute the programs you wish to implement. Drawing out a map of what I wanted to achieve with my code helped me organize and strategize my thinking. 
- Can you draw any conclusion about programming in general from the similarities or the differences between the two languages? 
Programming requires careful thought and discussion in order to transform an idea into a full fledged program that a user can interact with. You need to ensure that your logic is sound and that each line of code has its purpose. The general idea behind programming is the same as you need things in your program such as conditionals, loops, and variables no matter what language you're working with. 
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
There's some logical error with my loop that I need to fix for revisions. Some advice I would give is that learning to code is hard and it will take a lot of effort to think your way through the problems. Drawing out a flow chart helped me when I was stuck and didn't know which way to turn. I also looked for guides and resources online to try to find code templates/examples that I could implement in my own program. In conclusion, it is ok to admit that you are stuck and it's best to reach out and communicate when problems arise.
